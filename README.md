# frontskel
FrontSkel is a simple microframework written in PHP based on bootstrap, jquery, fontawesome, slim, PHP-DI, smarty, monolog, composer and other cool stuff that will make your frontend web development startup easier.

**This is a development package that is not working as I want at the moment. Don't use it in production yet. Thank you.**
