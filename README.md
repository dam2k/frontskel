# frontskel
FrontSkel is a simple microframework written in PHP based on bootstrap, fontawesome, slim, PHP-DI, smarty, monolog, composer and other cool stuff that will make your frontend web development startup easier.

**This is a development, incomplete package that is not working at the moment. Don't use it in production yet, or use it only as a skeleton for Slim. Thank you.**
